    <p>For our final project, we dove deeper into our lab 3 assignment to make multiple optimizations to the Mandelbrot
       set generator. The original goal of our final project was replicating the PDP11, however we realized two weeks 
       into the project that it would be infeasible given the time constraints of the project. As such, we devised a 
       project with a shorter timeline (~2.5 weeks) that could take advantage of the work we did in previous labs. 
       One topic that interested both of us was that of FPGA resource and timing optimization, and we saw the 
       Mandelbrot set generator lab as a perfect project to continue with. Specifically, we wanted to improve upon the 
       calculation time of the Mandelbrot set from our lab3 baseline by getting the most out of the memory, DSPs and 
       logic onboard the DE1-SoC. This allowed us to focus directly on optimization and design improvements without 
       the overhead of building and debugging a new design from scratch. We were also able to improve the usability of 
       the renderer by adding finer zooming and introducing an animation feature.</p>
