    <p>Despite having to switch projects halfway, we were still able to put together a meaningful project by building 
       upon the previous work done in lab 3. In the end, we were able to put together an enhanced Mandelbrot set 
       generator that greatly outperformed our lab 3 implementation. The performance and usability exceeded our 
       expectations, as we were able to get smooth panning and zooming motion. If this project was done as a 
       full-length final project, we would have had more time to spend in optimizing performance, potentially 
       running a 150 MHz PLL, and getting rid of bugs such as the few flickering/striping pixels that were in our 
       final result. Working on the Verilog on two machines at once while also working on the C code was one thing 
       that worked very well, as it allowed for greater productivity. Overall, we very much enjoyed working on this 
       project and are very happy with the final result.</p>
